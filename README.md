BundleIDsII
===========

A Cydia application to retrieve the bundle ID of any of app on your device with the push of a button.

This is a rewrite of BundleIDsXI to support iOS 13 as well as use SparkDev's libSparkAppList instead of Ryan Petrich's AppList. This is an incomplete build and currently does not compile at all. I just have not had a lot of time to continue working on this project. However, if you would like to assist with finishing this build then please feel free to do so. If you are able to finish the rewrite I am more than happy to add your name to the developer title on the package as well as give credit anywhere that I can including, but not limited to, the package depiction, release post, etc. Thank you in advance for any help with completing this build! Please see below for the original source code readme from BundleIDsXI.


BundleIDsXI
===========

This was originally created by Noah Saso (Sassoty) but updated for iOS 11 seeing as it is no longer being updated by noah and is only compiled for 32-bit. A huge thanks to @TheTomMetzger and @Skittyblock for all of their insane help on this project. This project should currently supports all devices that run iOS 11.0.0 - 12.1.2. I currently have plans to add a few new features to this project as well to make it even better than the amazing work by the original developer as well as bringing the code a little more up to date.
